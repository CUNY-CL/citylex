===========================================

CityLex is now available as a [free web app](https://citylex.onrender.com/). Most users should just use this app.

Users who want to run a local instance of this web app should use the [`webapp` branch](https://github.com/CUNY-CL/citylex/tree/webapp).

The legacy Python library is available under the [`legacy` branch](https://github.com/CUNY-CL/citylex/tree/legacy).
