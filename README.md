ðŸ—½ CityLex: a free multisource English lexical database
======================================================

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/wikipron.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/wikipron)
[![Supported Python versions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/wikipron.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/wikipron)

CityLex is an English lexical database intended to replace or enhance
databases like [CELEX](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC96L14). It
combines data from up to seven unique sources, including frequency
norms, morphological analyses, and pronunciations. Since these have
varying license conditions (some are proprietary, others restrict
redistribution), we do not provide the database as is. Rather the user
must generate a personal copy by executing a Python script, enabling
whatever sources they wish to use.

Building your CityLex
---------------------

To install CityLex run: `pip install .` in the current directory.

To see the available data sources and options, run `citylex --help`.

To generate the lexicon, run `citylex` without the help options and
at least one data source enabled via the `--enable_X` flags. As most of
the data is downloaded from outline sources, an internet connection is
normally required. The process takes roughly five minutes with all
sources enabled; much of the time is spent downloading large files.

File formats
------------

Two files are produced. The first, by default `citylex.tsv`, is a standard
wide-format "tab separated values" (TSV) file, of the sort that can be read
into Excel or R. Some fields (particularly pronunciations and morphological
analyses) can have multiple entries per wordform. In this case, they are
separated using the `^` character.

Advanced users may wish to make use of the second file,
by default `citylex.textproto`, a
[text-format](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/python/google.protobuf.text_format-module)
[protocol buffer](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) which
provides a better representation of the repeated fields. To parse this
file in Python, use the following snippet:

``` {.sourceCode .python}
from google.protobuf import text_format

import citylex_pb2

lexicon = citylex_pb2.Lexicon()
with open("citylex.textproto, "r") as source: 
   text_format.ParseLines(source, lexicon)
```

This will parse the text-format data and populate `lexicon`. One can
then iterate over `lexicon.entry` like a Python dictionary.

Non-redistributable data sources
--------------------------------

Not all CityLex data can be obtained automatically from online sources.
If you wish to enable CELEX or ELP data, follow the instructions below.

-   CELEX \[proprietary\]: This resource is obtained from the
    [LDC](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC96L14) as `LDC96L14.tgz`. The
    file must be decompressed using

        tar -xzf LDC96L14.tgz

This will produce a directory named `celex2`.
To enable CELEX2 features, use `--enable_celex` and
pass the local path of this directory as an argument to `--celex_path`.

-   ELP \[noncommercial\]: This resource must be obtained from the
    authors' website. Visit:

    http://elexicon.wustl.edu/WordStart.asp

noting that the underlying website is unfortunately rather unreliable.
Once there, you will be presented with a series of checkboxes.
Enable the fields labeled "MorphSp (Morpheme Parse - Letters)" and
"NMorph (Number of Morphemes)" under "Morphological Characteristics".
Then, below, select the radio button labeled "The complete ELP Lexicon"
on the left, and "Email" on the right.
Then click "Execute Query".
You will be prompted for an email address: enter one.
You will then receive a TSV file via email containing these fields.
Download it and do not modify it further.
To enable ELP features, use `--enable_elp` and pass the local path of
the downloaded TSV file as an argument to `--elp_path`.

For more information
--------------------

-   `citylex.proto` for the protocol buffer data structure
-   `citylex.bib` for references to the data sources used

For contributors
----------------

To regenerate `citylex_pb2.py` you will need to install the
[Protocol Buffers C++ runtime](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf)
for your platform, making sure the version number (e.g., the one returned by
`protoc --version` matches that of the `protobudf` in `requirements.txt`.
Then, run `protoc --python_out=. citylex.proto`.
